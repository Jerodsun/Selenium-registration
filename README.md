# Selenium-registration

Putting Automation knowledge into practice.

### Update 9/19/2019:
It appears that 2FA is now globally enforced. Therefore there needs to be an extra step to deal with sending keys with user input manually this time. In that case, the smart move to do is to time the `input()` to match with the exact open time.


## Instructions:
### Create a `secrets.py` file
required variables:
- netid
- password

### Download chromedriver
Put on root the appropriate version https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads
